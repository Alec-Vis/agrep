AGREP -- an approximate GREP. 

Fast searching files for a string or regular expression, with approximate matching capabilities and user-definable records. 

Developed 1989-1991 by Udi Manber, Sun Wu et al. at the University of Arizona.

           Approximate Pattern Matching GREP -- Get Regular Expression
Usage:
AGREP [-#cdehi[a|#]klnprstvwxyABDGIRS] [-f patternfile] [-H dir] pattern [files]
-#  find matches with at most # errors     -A  always output filenames
-b  print byte offset of match
-c  output the number of matched records   -B  find best match to the pattern
-d  define record delimiter                -Dk deletion cost is k
-e  for use when pattern begins with -     -G  output the files with a match
-f  name of file containing patterns       -Ik insertion cost is k
-h  do not display file names              -Sk substitution cost is k
-i  case-insensitive search; ISO <> ASCII  -ia ISO chars mapped to lower ASCII
-i# digits-match-digits, letters-letters   -i0 case-sensitive search
-k  treat pattern literally - no meta-characters
-l  output the names of files that contain a match
-n  print line numbers of matches  -q print buffer byte offsets
-p  supersequence search                   -CP 850|437 set codepage
-r  recurse subdirectories (UNIX style)    -s silent
-t  for use when delimiter is at the end of records
-v  output those records without matches   -V[012345V] version / verbose more
-w  pattern has to match as a word: "win" will not match "wind"
-u  unterdruecke record output             -x  pattern must match a whole line
-y  suppresses the prompt when used with -B best match option
@listfile  use the filenames in listfile                              <1>23456Q
```
