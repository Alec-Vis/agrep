Hi,

I recently had need of a version of agrep that ran on Windows NT and I
didn't want to install emx and/or rsx.  So I took the source code and
did a quick port to Windows.  It now runs natively at the command line
under Windows 95 (very little testing) and Windows NT (NT 4.0 SP3 where
I did the work).  I compiled the code using Microsoft VC 5.0.  My
changes were minor with the biggest changes being the addition of two
new files (public domain code) that handle the dirent.h type functions
(I called them ntdirent.c and ntdirent.h).  I also added function
prototypes to reduce the number of warning messages so I could see the
real problems but I didn't do anything with the numerous signed/unsigned
comparison warnings.  I also linked with the Microsoft globbing object
code so file globbing is now taken care of automatically without
resorting to response files.  For completeness sake I'll tell you that I
didn't touch the codepage stuff (except to get it to compile) because I
don't need it. 

I'm attaching a zip file of the modified source code.  It contains an
agrep executable (compiled without debugging), a makefile (agrep.mak),
and the output of the differences between my version and version 3.33.  

The diff command used to get the diff file was:  diff -u -r -new-file
agrep.org agrep.win
The patch command to apply the changes to the original is: patch -N <
agrep.dif
To compile the sources I used: nmake -f agrep.mak  (by default this
creates the release version)

Do with what you will with the changes; I have what I need and don't
have the time to support the code.  I'm hoping that you can find some
use from my day's work.

Good Luck,
David

Tom,

Attached to this email is my update to your 3.35 sources of agrep.  The
changes you made were small so it didn't take too long.

Included in the zip file is:
(1)    a diff of the 3.33 to 3.35 changes (333to335.dif)
(2)    a diff of my changes to 3.35 (AgrepWin.dif)
(3)    a makefile for Microsoft VC 5.0 (Agrep.mak)
(4)    an executable compiled without debugging (Agrep.exe)

For your information I did a quick compile and some testing using
BoundsChecker from NuMega Software.  The only problem it found was on
line 723 of sgrep.c.  BoundsChecker complains about an uninitialized
memory access.  In the agrep source directory I was using the command:
agrep -r "main" *.*  .  I don't have time to track it down completely
but I do know that the problem happens during the processing of
codepage.c,  It seems to have something to do with a character very high
(or out of) the SHIFT table.  Sorry I don't have time right now to look
any further.  The good news is that nothing else was found as being a
problem.

Good Luck,
Dave
